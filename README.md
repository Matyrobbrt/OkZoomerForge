# LibZoomer

A library that allows other mods to create zooms and custom spyglasses easily. The current supported version is Minecraft 1.18.2.

## Usage

**WARNING:** This API is still not finished and breaking changes may happen until a 1.0.0 release happens!

This library is available through Maven Central and Jitpack. If none of these options work, consider using local Maven on the source code of a released version.

LibZoomer provides zooming through zoom instances, which contains three sub-instances: transition modes, mouse modifiers and zoom overlays. A zoom instance can be created with different subinstances, which can be either provided by the library or implemented by the mod itself. In order to a zoom instance to be functional, it must be registered by the ZoomRegistry. In order to make the instance zoom in, the instance's zoom state must be set to true, which can be done using the `setZoom` method, the vice-versa can be done by setting it to false.

A better guide will be written later, feel free to take a look on this mod's testmod if you want an example!
